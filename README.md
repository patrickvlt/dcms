# DCMS
DCMS is a Laravel package with various Front-End plugins, and Back-End traits to dynamically bootstrap code.

This package will include a separate portal aswell (which you can enable or disable).
The purpose of this package is to help developers easily setup a basic CMS in any kind of website.

This package will boost your productivity when you're developing CRUD applications, since the Front-End and Back-End code in this package work with each other out of the box. All you have to do is include the DCMSController trait in your controller, setup your construct method correctly, and include the root dcms.js file.

Documentation will be finished soon.
