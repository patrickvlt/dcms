# DCMS
DCMS is a Laravel package with various Front-End plugins, and Back-End traits to dynamically bootstrap code, which will automatically communicate with each other.

It ships with a separate portal aswell (which you can enable or disable).

The purpose of DCMS is to help developers easily setup a basic CMS in any kind of website.

DCMS will boost your productivity when you're developing CRUD applications, since the Front-End and Back-End code in this package work with each other out of the box. 
All you have to do is include the DCMSController trait in your controller, setup your construct method correctly, and include the root JS and CSS files of DCMS.

Documentation will be finished soon.
